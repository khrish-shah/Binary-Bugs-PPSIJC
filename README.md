# Binary-Bugs-PPSIJC

About us: Our team binary bugs aspires to teach finances to as many people as possible while enhancing our coding knowledge to touch the stars.
Our services: Our project for NHack code for good on the topic of financial inclusions was to find out about microfinances and microfinance solutions to combat financial illiteracy. We have mentioned about what is microfinance and brief descriptions about methods and advantages for microfinance solutions. We aspire to teach people and spread awareness about finance.
